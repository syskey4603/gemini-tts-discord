discord bot that can communicate with you using the gemini api in a voice call

i have no idea why i made it but its pretty cool


to use it add your api key to the API_KEY variable and your token for the bot
in your server run $settschannel and put the channel id that you want to use to communicate with the bot
now run $startts and you should be in a voice call 
it will join and you can start talking to it in the channel you set and it will respond in the voice call
